## Setup
```
    npm install --save react react-dom next
```
## Run nextjs app
```
    next
```
Next uses the **pages** directory and the files in them to map its routes. 
This means if we have a file called index.js in our pages folder, Next would try to use the component in it as our entry point. 

## Run nextjs with express
```
    node ssr-server.js
```
